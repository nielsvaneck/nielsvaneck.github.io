I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up with much exposure to seafood either, as my home village is about an hour and a half from the North Sea, which by Dutch standards is about the equivalent of Colorado&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the nearest ocean. One exception that forms a staple &amp;ldquo;fish at home&amp;rdquo; memory is smoked trout. The fishing pond purveyors would smoke whole trout once or twice a week and my dad would frequently pick up a few for dinner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years later, in search of new hobbies, dad decided he&amp;rsquo;d like to try his hand at smoking fish and some time in 2018, when I happened to be visiting, we went and picked up a smoker. After some trial and error &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niels/status/980164399435481093">we got the process down&lt;/a>. These days, dad still visits the fishing pond but now picks up fresh fish–killed and gutted–and does the smoking at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a later trip to the Netherlands, I spent a week running that smoker almost every day; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niels/status/1013787840256315393">cooking ribs&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niels/status/1014224114901544961">chicken&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niels/status/1015162245192585216">more ribs&lt;/a> and of course, some trout. That experience got me excited about smoking meat and I started experimenting with smoker boxes and slow cooked pork ribs on my Weber gas grill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Naturally, I quickly &amp;ldquo;needed&amp;rdquo; better equipment and bought a &lt;a href="https://pitbarrelcooker.com">Pit Barrel&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://pitbarrelcooker.com/collections/cookers/products/14-pit-barrel-junior">Junior&lt;/a>. I love that smoker. It&amp;rsquo;s a rib cooking machine. The Junior is a good size and I have thrown it in the back of the car to cook at my in-laws, but sometimes I wonder if I should have gotten the bigger one instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, after a few cooks on the Pit Barrel, I figured I should give trout a try. My wife took me to a Japanese market in Berkeley and we picked up 2 big specimen. The Pit Barrel comes with hooks that let you hang meat off of rebar at the top of the barrel. I tried doubling up the hooks in each fish to spread the load but disaster struck and one fish fell into the fire 😢.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/trout-disaster.jpeg" alt="Despite double hooks, one trout fell into the fire 😢">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite that setback, the lone &amp;ldquo;survivor&amp;rdquo; was delicious!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fish smoking is quite common in Europe and I remembered that dad&amp;rsquo;s smoker came with special hooks for hanging trout and eel. These hangers are made of thinner gauge steel and have two hooks that hold the fish. I tried finding similar hangers on Amazon and other places and even considered ordering them from a &lt;a href="https://www.vuurenrook.nl/en/smoking-cooking/smoke-meat-hooks/">BBQ store in the Netherlands&lt;/a>, but I guess the pandemic caused a BBQ equipment purchasing spree and the hooks were all sold out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My obvious next step was to make them myself. I bought two &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EXTENDABLE-FORK-VALUE-MfrPartNo-G23002/dp/B008D2WNIO">cheap extendable grill forks&lt;/a> from my local Ace Hardware to provide material and went to work with a Mapp torch, a vise and some pliers. An hour of heating, bending, twisting and cutting later, this was the result:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/fish-smoking-hooks.jpeg" alt="Home made fish hangers">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had my in-laws over that day and my wife had picked up some whole trout from Costco. (We&amp;rsquo;ve since also seen them at Whole Foods)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The custom hooks worked a treat, gravity did not ruin our dinner and we&amp;rsquo;ve used them several times since. On top of all that, my in-laws loved the trout, so I&amp;rsquo;ve got that going for me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess this is where we get to the point in this story where I actually tell you how to Smoke Trout on a Pit Barrel Cooker : )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/costco-whole-trout.jpeg" alt="Whole trout from Costco">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="brine">Brine&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Start by rinsing off your fish, remove any guts that may still be sitting around and submerge the fish in an appropriately size container.
Add about a half cup of salt and let the fish brine in the fridge for at least two hours but ideally overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/trout-in-salt-bath.jpeg" alt="Whole trout in an overnight salt bath">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hang">Hang&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Remove the fish from the brine, rinse and place the hangers. For smaller fish, double hooking with the Pit Barrel hooks should be OK but if you have fancier hooks use those! I&amp;rsquo;ve had good luck placing a hanger through the mouth and hooking between ribs on either side of the spine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/hook-placement.jpeg" alt="Place a hanger through the mouth and hook between ribs on either side of the spine">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="smoke">Smoke&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Light your Pit Barrel according to instructions, but don&amp;rsquo;t overfill your fire basket. Smoking only takes about an hour and trout don&amp;rsquo;t weigh that much, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need that much heat. I usually try to keep the pit temp between 200 and 250 (F). I sometimes add some wood chips for extra flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/whole-trout-in-pit-barrel.jpeg" alt="Trout in the Pit Barrel">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the internal temp reaches about 145 (F) and the skin has a nice golden sheen, your trout is done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/smoked-trout-filet.jpeg" alt="Smoked trout filet">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The skin should come right off and the filet should lift off the ribs with ease. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the head either. Just below the eye socket, the jaw muscles are wonderful chunks of goodness. A bit finicky to get at, but very tasty!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Enjoy!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this sidestep from the usual technical drivel is useful to someone. If you have suggestions or if you want some fish hangers, get in touch!&lt;/p>

Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve used Mermaid diagrams and the script presented in that post in &lt;code>README.md&lt;/code> docs for a couple of projects. While the script works great, having to remember to run it or plumb client side automation to do so automatically can be a bit of a hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had been toying with the idea of putting the script up in a GitHub repository, for easy inclusion as a git submodule, and then realized that turning that into a GitHub Action would be even easier. So, that&amp;rsquo;s what I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GitHub Actions, if you&amp;rsquo;re new to the term, is GitHub&amp;rsquo;s workflow system for build automation, continuous integration, or whatever other task you might want to perform in reaction to repository changes. Think of an Action as a small program. Actions are the building blocks of workflows. A few Actions put together in a workflow operate in the same execution environment and have access to the same file system that usually contained a fresh checkout of your repository. Actions combined in a workflow can build your code, run your tests, deploy to staging or production, &lt;a href="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/2021-01-09-bye-wordpress/">generate static html and publish your website&lt;/a> and now also render Mermaid diagrams in Markdown files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="render-md-mermaid">render-md-mermaid&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Action I built, &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/render-md-mermaid">&lt;code>render-md-mermaid&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, can be used in any GitHub repository. Put it in a workflow, together with &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout">&lt;code>checkout&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-auto-commit">&lt;code>git-auto-commit&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and it will automatically render any Mermaid diagram in any Markdown file (if &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsvaneck/render-md-mermaid/blob/main/README.md#mermaid-in-markdown">formatted correctly&lt;/a>) wherever it runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install it in your repo, add the following &lt;code>yaml&lt;/code> configuration to &lt;code>.github/workflows/render-md-mermaid.yml&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">render-md-mermaid&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">file_pattern&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;*[.svg,.png]&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">commit_message&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">automatically rendered mermaid diagrams&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This workflow uses GitHub&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>checkout&lt;/code> action to get the latest copy of your repository, then runs &lt;code>render-md-mermaid&lt;/code> on it and finally commits any &lt;code>.svg&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.png&lt;/code> files that were generated in the process back to the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsvaneck/render-md-mermaid">render-md-mermaid Action&lt;/a> is built using the mermaid-cli Docker image. I had to make some small tweaks to the way the mermaid client is invoked, but the &lt;code>render-md-mermaid.sh&lt;/code> script that does the heavy lifting is able to run stand-alone and in-container.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, the biggest hurdle I ran into was figuring out the correct &lt;code>file_pattern&lt;/code> parameter to &lt;code>git-auto-commit&lt;/code>. Even though the script &lt;em>should&lt;/em> only create image files, I wanted to make sure nothing else gets comitted by accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found the documented examples did not work for my use case where you may have a &lt;code>.svg&lt;/code> file but not a &lt;code>.png&lt;/code> or vice versa. Ultimately, I found that &lt;code>&amp;quot;*[.svg,.png]&amp;quot;&lt;/code> –in double quotes because it starts with a &lt;code>*&lt;/code>, a special character in YAML– matches any &lt;code>.svg&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.png&lt;/code> file that may show up in &lt;code>git status&lt;/code> as a result of diagram generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plans">Plans&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My goal is to add some &lt;a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">&lt;code>bats&lt;/code>&lt;/a> tests and if the Action gets some usage, I may play around with ways to pass a stylesheet and configuration to the Mermaid renderer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, I hope this is useful to someone. If so, or if you have suggestions, shoot me a note!&lt;/p>

While documenting something technical, this usually means diving into the drawing section of whatever editor you&amp;rsquo;re using and wrangling with lines and boxes until you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied with your masterpiece or you&amp;rsquo;ve exhausted your patience with the tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I write a fair bit of Markdown which unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer such luxuries as drawing tools and embedded editable image support. Or does it?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="typora">Typora&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Last year, I started using &lt;a href="https://typora.io">Typora&lt;/a>, an absolutely amazing Markdown editor. Typora lets you write Markdown in its rendered state and the interface is clutter free, reminiscent of the &amp;ldquo;distraction free&amp;rdquo; writing apps that were all the rage a few years ago. I was poking around Typora&amp;rsquo;s docs and saw something interesting; &lt;a href="https://support.typora.io/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/">Draw Diagrams With Markdown&lt;/a>. As it turns out, Typora will render diagrams embedded in tagged code blocks using one of 3 Javascript graphing libraries, &lt;code>js-sequence&lt;/code>, &lt;code>flowchart.js&lt;/code> and the most versatile of the three, &lt;code>mermaid&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All three libraries are integrated and invoked using a &lt;code>```&lt;/code> codeblock–tagged with either &lt;code>sequence&lt;/code>, &lt;code>flow&lt;/code> or &lt;code>mermaid&lt;/code>– that contains the graph definition. I decided to put it to use and drew a pretty big mermaid diagram in a readme file for one of last year&amp;rsquo;s projects. It was nice to be able to define the graph in code and keep documentation and imagery close together. &lt;em>(imagine, having search-and-replace that covers the labels in your diagrams! 🤯 )&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, not all Markdown viewers render mermaid–or any other–graphs, most notably, GitHub does not support them. My solution at the time was to use the &lt;a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/">Mermaid Live Editor&lt;/a> to generate a rendered version of my graph and link that image in the readme file. I also &amp;ldquo;hid&amp;rdquo; the graph source in a collapsible &lt;code>&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code> block and added a plea to future maintainers, along with an explanation on how to generate the image. Not ideal, but at least it would show the rendered image on GitHub and hide the graph source to readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But again, &amp;ldquo;Not ideal&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="automated-mermaid-rendering">Automated Mermaid Rendering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was going to put together a post about Typora and Mermaid and while mulling over what to write, I thought 💡 &amp;ldquo;what if I automate my work-around for rendering mermaid graphs?&amp;quot;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> A few hours of tinkering later, I came up with a script and a &lt;code>make&lt;/code> target that can be included in any GitHub repo&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The script takes a Markdown file and looks for occurrences of blocks that look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">![&lt;span style="color:#f92672">graph image alt-text&lt;/span>](&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">path/to/image.png&lt;/span>)
&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672">details&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672">summary&lt;/span>&amp;gt;diagram source&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#f92672">summary&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
what text goes here, or what is in the summary tags doesn&amp;#39;t matter. it gets collapsed along with the following mermaid graph definition
```mermaid
graph TD
A[README.md] --&amp;gt;|passed to| B
subgraph render-md-mermaid.sh
B{Find mermaid graphs&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672">br&lt;/span>&amp;gt;and image paths} --&amp;gt; C(docker mermaid-cli)

```
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#f92672">details&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once the script has executed, the graph (and its source) will be rendered as follows:&lt;/p>

rm .render-md-mermaid-config.json .render-md-mermaid.css
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit going on there, but the main bits are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a beefy regular expression that matches multiple lines, from the markdown image tag, followed by a &lt;code>details&lt;/code> block opening to a markdown code block ending before the end of that &lt;code>details&lt;/code> block&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this regular expression is executed using perl, which was the only way I found to reliably run a multi-line matching regex&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we loop over each line captured by the regex and filter out the image filename and the graph source. the graph source is written to a temporary file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>next, for every graph found, it invokes &lt;code>mermaid-cli&lt;/code> using &lt;code>docker run&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finally, for svg output we work around a bug where rendered newlines in the svg code are not properly formatted&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The script can be invoked manually, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it handy to invoke it in a &lt;code>make&lt;/code> workflow. That way, graphs are rendered without having to give it a single thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-Makefile" data-lang="Makefile">&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">render-md-mermaid&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">$(&lt;/span>shell find . -name &amp;#34;render-md-mermaid.sh&amp;#34;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">$(&lt;/span>shell find . -name &amp;#34;*.md&amp;#34;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">## Render all mermaid graphs in any .md file in the repository
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span> @for md in &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">$(&lt;/span>shell find . -name &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;*.md&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">)&lt;/span>; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>$&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;lt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>$$&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">md&amp;#34;&lt;/span>; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">done&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The &lt;code>make&lt;/code> target uses a little trick to find the script by referencing it as a prerequisite along with all &lt;code>.md&lt;/code> files in the repository. It then loops through the &lt;code>.md&lt;/code> files and invokes &lt;code>render-md-mermaid.sh&lt;/code>. (&lt;code>$&amp;lt;&lt;/code> is set to the first prerequisite)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m planning to put this script and other repository utilities in a separate repo on GitHub. This repo can be included as a submodule and provide its utilities to any project, without introducing a bunch of duplicated code. More on that later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/2021-01-31-render-md-markdown-a-github-action/">I ended up writing a GitHub Action that uses this script with minimal setup required.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Our son was born around the same time and so the site sat idle for a few months, but when I picked up writing back in November, the experience with Wordpress irked me. Wordpress is a fine CMS, it is great for getting a quick blog up and going, but I wanted more control over my content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niels/status/1339617478406631425?s=20">much to my surprise&lt;/a>, I was able to re-register nielsvaneck.com and that inspired me to move my site and finally ditch Wordpress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a software engineer, writing in Markdown and using a Git repository as a home for my content is more natural than using an opaque CMS. With that as a basis, there are some surprisingly simple methods for setting up a website / blog. &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages&lt;/a> offers basic (and free!) hosting from a Git repo. It can be configured to serve on custom hostnames and it even handles SSL! ✔️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get content in Markdown served up as HTML, GitHub Pages uses &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll&lt;/a>, an HTML generator written in Ruby, but with a little bit of work, &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a>, the &amp;lsquo;static-site-generator-du-jour&amp;rsquo;, can also be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in the span of an evening of tinkering, I now have the following setup:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown">&lt;code>wordpress-export-to-markdown&lt;/code>&lt;/a> to generate a Markdown version of my exported Wordpress site&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that Markdown content is kept in a private Git repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a GitHub action using &lt;a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-remote">&lt;code>hugo-remote&lt;/code>&lt;/a> automatically generates static HTML pages when the Markdown content is updated and pushes changes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsvaneck/nielsvaneck.github.io/">nielsvaneck.github.io&lt;/a>, which is served at &lt;a href="https://nielsvaneck.com">https://nielsvaneck.com&lt;/a> using GitHub Pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a separate repository hosts a few simple HTML redirects to handle old links to posts on &lt;a href="https://nve.ventures">https://nve.ventures&lt;/a> (also served on GitHub Pages)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not super happy with the looks of the site yet, but that&amp;rsquo;s a matter of toying around with Hugo Themes. The important thing is that the setup works and that my content is fully in my control. 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope that was useful, and as they say, watch this space.&lt;/p>

By defining what sources a build target operates on, it could automatically determine what should be compiled based on what files had changed, thus saving on computing time while guaranteeing correct builds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="command-vs-automatic-targets">Command vs Automatic Targets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The ability to define build targets that could be invoked from the command line as &lt;code>make&lt;/code> arguments, quickly lead to Make being used for other tasks than just building software, think of &lt;code>make install&lt;/code> for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;extracurricular&amp;rdquo; usage of the Make build tool proves useful to this day. A Makefile at the root of your repository provides a quick way to define commands for; bootstrapping the repository, running code-generation, executing tests, kicking off deployment and last but not least, if your project requires it, building executables. I have been thinking about these targets as &amp;ldquo;commands&amp;rdquo;, they are the main entry points into the functionality of your Makefile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A well equipped makefile becomes a command line tool for your repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beauty of Make is its dependency system. By defining prerequisites &lt;em>(what targets should run before your target, and/or did any of the files-your- target-depends-on change, thus requiring your target to run)&lt;/em>, you can ensure for example; that code is built before running tests, or that tests re-execute with updated coverage tracking configuration, before opening the test-coverage report in a browser. Let&amp;rsquo;s call targets in these dependency chains &amp;ldquo;Automatic&amp;rdquo; targets. They are like building blocks. You&amp;rsquo;d rarely execute them individually, but together they enable powerful functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Makefiles in this exact way. The Makefile offers a command line interface to the repository. It can be used to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>bootstrap the repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>generate code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run various linters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run django, both as a server and in shell mode&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run tests, with or without coverage tracking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>open coverage reports in a browser (which of course automatically re-executes tests when necessary)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>build docker containers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run django shell &amp;amp; server inside the docker container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run tests inside of the docker container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>deploy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>configure cloud tools to target development, staging or production environments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>forward ports to a kubernetes pod&lt;/li>
&lt;li>etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All that, performed with required prerequisite work, by just running make with a simple argument. It has been a joy to use. But as so often in life, you can&amp;rsquo;t have a silver lining without a cloud. This abundance of functionality in a Makefile brings with it two problems. 1) Silo-ing of potentially re-usable functionality and, 2), poor user experience, due to lack of target discoverability and an epic case of cognitive overload when trying to read through them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="make-help">Make help&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most Makefiles contain a boat load of targets, alphabetically-ish sorted if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky. There is no good way to distinguish command targets from automatic targets, let alone to get a quick idea of what you can do with a Makefile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite that shortcoming, I still thought it was worth writing about this particular way of Makefile usage. In past employment and projects, I’ve seen countless examples of important commands having to be copied from documentation, and I don’t know how I would have done my job without relying heavily on bash history. Makefiles with a variety of command targets would have been very valuable to me in those days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, while doing some research for this post, I came across &lt;a href="https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-self-documenting-makefile/">how to create a self-documenting Makefile&lt;/a>, by &lt;a href="https://victoria.dev/">Victoria Drake&lt;/a>. In that article, she not only outlines my repository command line tool use-case for Makefiles, it goes on to introduce the exact thing I had missed in my Makefiles, a quick way to get an overview of the commands contained within them 🤯 🎉.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Some more Googling revealed that variants of this &lt;code>help&lt;/code> target have been presented &lt;a href="https://www.cmcrossroads.com/print/article/self-documenting-makefiles">a&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/prwhite/8168133">few&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.thapaliya.com/en/writings/well-documented-makefiles/">numerous&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html">times&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201804/makefile_help_target.html">over&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://aben20807.github.io/posts/20190402-makefile-help-message/">the&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8889035/how-to-document-a-makefile">years&lt;/a>, ultimately evolving to the version published by Victoria. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>first it loops over &lt;code>MAKEFILE_LIST&lt;/code> (a list of all lines in the makefile that define a target) using &lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=egrep&amp;amp;format=html">&lt;code>egrep&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, and retains the lines that have a &lt;code>##&lt;/code> comment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it then &lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sort&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;sektion=0&amp;amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;amp;arch=default&amp;amp;format=html">&lt;code>sort&lt;/code>&lt;/a>s the remaining items&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and finally, runs the sorted lines through &lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=awk&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;sektion=0&amp;amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;amp;arch=default&amp;amp;format=html">&lt;code>awk&lt;/code>&lt;/a>`, with a few tricks
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>BEGIN {FS = &amp;quot;:.*?## &amp;quot;};&lt;/code>
&lt;code>BEGIN&lt;/code> denotes a block that is to be executed before any input is processed. This block assigns &lt;code>FS&lt;/code>, the &lt;em>Field Separator&lt;/em>, to a regular expression that matches everything from the semicolon (which follows the target name), including the prerequisite list to the &lt;code>##&lt;/code> that indicates a ‘help’ comment. This causes each Makefile target line to be broken up in the target name (&lt;code>$1&lt;/code>) and the help comment (&lt;code>$2&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>{printf &amp;quot;\033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n&amp;quot;, $$1, $$2}&lt;/code>
this one seems a little tricky at first, as there is a lot going on, but simply put, it uses &lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=printf&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;sektion=0&amp;amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;amp;arch=default&amp;amp;format=html">&lt;code>printf&lt;/code>&lt;/a> to output the target name and the help comment in two columns.
Let’s break the format string into its parts:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>\033[&lt;/code> starts a terminal escape sequence and 36m then sets the text color to “light cyan”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>%-20s&lt;/code> will print a string variable, the target name, padded on the right up to a width of 20 characters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>\033[&lt;/code> starts another escape sequence in which &lt;code>0m&lt;/code> resets the text color&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>%s\n&lt;/code> prints the second string variable, the help text, along with a newline character.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>$$1&lt;/code>, &lt;code>$$2&lt;/code> are the first and second parts of the line, target name and help comment as broken up based on the Field Separator rule defined earlier. &lt;code>$$&lt;/code> because &lt;code>$&lt;/code> needs to be doubled up inside a Makefile.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With the &lt;code>help&lt;/code> target defined in the Makefile, and &amp;ldquo;command&amp;rdquo; targets annotated with &lt;code>## help text&lt;/code> comments, executing &lt;code>make help&lt;/code> will now print out a quick overview of what you can do with the Makefile. Brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A nice side effect of &lt;code>## help text&lt;/code> comments on command targets is that it visually separates them from their &amp;ldquo;automatic&amp;rdquo; siblings when reading through the Makefile.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="makefile-target-re-use">Makefile target re-use&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When using Makefiles as a command interface for your repository, it will likely contain targets that can be shared with other repositories in your organization or other projects you work on. The &lt;code>help&lt;/code> target presented above is a prime example. Most Makefiles are self-contained. Their targets are specific to the repository and project they exist in. But Makefiles can &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html">include&lt;/a> other Makefiles, which offers a way to bring in common targets.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile">&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">-include&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">common.mk&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Makefile includes can live in a different repository, a git submodule, a symlinked directory, etc. The possibilities are endless. The Makefile could even contain bootstrap logic to fetch the included files. If that is the case, ensure the include statements are prefixed with &amp;ldquo;&lt;code>-&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;. This will ignore import errors and allow targets in the Makefile to run without the include files being present, thus preventing a bootstrap / include catch-22 situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past year, I have created Makefiles for various repositories based on the practices outlined above. Shared logic is brought in through git submodules and using make help, command targets are discoverable and documented. As an added bonus, maintaining and improving this toolkit is a great way to &amp;ldquo;get in the zone&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this wherever appropriate and I hope you will find it useful too. If so, drop me a line!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>btw, here are some resources for writing Makefiles I found helpful:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html">GNU Make Manual&lt;/a>. There is a *lot* to Make. (though I&amp;rsquo;ve had most luck just searching with Google)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/">Your Makefiles are wrong&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://tech.davis-hansson.com">Jacob Davis-Hansson&lt;/a> which introduced me to the concept of sentinel targets. These targets are named after- and &lt;code>touch&lt;/code> a &amp;ldquo;sentinel&amp;rdquo; file when the work is done. This allows targets that don&amp;rsquo;t produce anything or produce multiple files to function in a dependency chain. I use this a *lot* for writing &amp;ldquo;automation&amp;rdquo; targets.&lt;/li>

While guaranteed to–excuse the pun–cover the news, the newsletter is an always interesting distraction from current events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a few paragraphs, accompanied with sketches and more polished candidates that did not make the final cut, the email describes the creative and journalistic process that lead to that week&amp;rsquo;s magazine newspaper cover image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week&amp;rsquo;s cover story was fascinating as usual. It meandered past syringe filled images of rocketry, from corona virus symbolism to vaccine technology and ended up at a picture of hope, expressed by the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/images/40bebca3-2ed5-46a3-93e5-bb13fbb34704-779x1024.jpg" alt="The Economist Cover image for November 14-20, 2020 titled &amp;ldquo;Suddenly, hope&amp;rdquo;Depicting a right curving tunnel, with one of it&amp;rsquo;s segments shaped like a SARS-CoV-2 virus particle. At the end of the tunnel, in a bright light shows a syringe filled with a vaccine dose, standing up like a rocket.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Economist Cover image for November 14-20, 2020&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most weeks, a glance at the cover image and the ensuing story about its creation match like a pea and a pod. This week was different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s me, I realize that good news of a vaccine brings a glimmer of hope in times of an ever escalating pandemic, but with the last 2-ish weeks behind us, in seeing that tunnel I never even noticed the virus particle outline or the syringe in the light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it was intended or not, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think The Economist could have better expressed the feeling of many people around the world, people who care about others and the planet, people who would like to see normality in their daily life–and maybe even the news–without spilling a drop of ink on the matter. Thank you.&lt;/p>

Stripe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">documentation&lt;/a> is outstanding. Their API is intuitive and the language specific clients are easy to use. Each Stripe account comes with a test environment that makes development and integration testing effortless. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli">&lt;code>stripe&lt;/code> command line tool&lt;/a> can be used for simple API queries, setting up authentication and testing of web hooks. On top of all that, there is &lt;a href="https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock">&lt;code>stripe-mock&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, a local service with a near- complete implementation of the API that can be used for testing and development without requiring a network connection to the Stripe Test environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue with stripe-mock–and with testing against (near) &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; versions of any API–is that it adds additional overhead to each test because you’ll likely have to use the API to define or tweak test data before it can be used. Once stripe-mock gets statefulness, that overhead will grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is fine for end-to-end testing where having tests walk a pre-designed path of API interactions that follow real-world usage is a good thing to do, but for unit testing, this amount of overhead leads to heavy tests that are hard to read and difficult to write. Life teaches us that if something is hard, we&amp;rsquo;re less likely to do lots of it. That is bad mojo for good test coverage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In past projects, I have seen several ways of dealing with this problem, from a test-library of pre-defined hardcoded fixture data, to full-on crazy Java-style builder factory monstrosities with class names that put the average German word length to shame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started looking at the internals of the Stripe python API client and found something very interesting. The JSON structure returned by the API is parsed into a Python &lt;code>dict&lt;/code> and then passed to a utility method that inspects the contents and builds the appropriate Stripe object hierarchy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This sparked an idea. If I could define a Python &lt;code>dict&lt;/code> with the right elements and invoke that Stripe utility method, I&amp;rsquo;d be able to define and build Stripe objects on the fly. Sprinkle in a little bit of builder-pattern and I&amp;rsquo;d have a quick, easy and readable way to build all varieties of Stripe objects needed to test my code. That in combination with Mockito (&lt;a href="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/2020-11-10-testing-python-with-mockito/">a great mocking framework for Python&lt;/a>) would make for a very functional and pleasant way of unit testing a Stripe integration built with Python. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a quick example of this through an imaginary Stripe integration function that retrieves the amount of an upcoming invoice for a customer defined by an email address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll have to look up the customer in Stripe using the email address (bad practice, I know, but bear with me here) and then invoke the API endpoint that returns the upcoming invoice and grab its &lt;code>amount_due&lt;/code> field. Note that &lt;code>Customer.list&lt;/code> returns a collection of Customer objects, even if there&amp;rsquo;s only one element.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> stripe
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">upcoming_amount_due&lt;/span>(customer_email):
customers &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> stripe&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>Customer&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>list(email&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>customer_email)
customer &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> customers&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>data[&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>]
upcoming_invoice &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> stripe&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>Invoice&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>upcoming(customer&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>customer&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>id)
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> upcoming_invoice&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>amount_due
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Writing a test for this example would require setting up a fair amount of fixture data as well as several API calls to get the expected state, regardless of whether we would use Stripe&amp;rsquo;s test environment or &lt;code>stripe-mock&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;d have to create a Customer, ensure a Product structure is set up, then create a Subscription with one Subscription Item to your product and depending on the type of Subscription, you may even have to report some usage in order to trigger an upcoming invoice amount. I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with a code example of all that, but I hope you agree that that would be a hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how that same unit test would be written using the Stripe object builders and Mockito:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> stripe
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">from&lt;/span> mockito &lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> when
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">from&lt;/span> unittest &lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> TestCase
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">from&lt;/span> my_stripe_implementation &lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> upcoming_amount_due
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">from&lt;/span> my_stripe_builders &lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">StripeUnitTest&lt;/span>(TestCase):
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">test_upcoming_amount_due&lt;/span>(self):
test_email &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test@example.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
expected_amount &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5000&lt;/span>
customer_builder &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> StripeCustomerBuilder()
customer &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> customer_builder&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>build()
customer_list &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> StripeListBuilder()&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>add(
customer_builder)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>build()
when(stripe&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>Customer)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>list(
email&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>test_email)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>thenReturn(customer_list)
when(stripe&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>Invoice)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>upcoming(
customer&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>customer&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>id)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>thenReturn(
StripeInvoiceBuilder()
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>amount_due(expected_amount)
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>build())
self&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>assertEqual(expected_amount, upcoming_amount_due(test_email))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Using a combination of pre-defined fixture data and overrides where needed, the object builders allow for quickly setting up test data. The code under test invokes the Stripe API client, but through the use of Mockito, it will receive the test objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, for this test, we could have entirely mocked out the objects with Mockito, but when the code under tests uses more of the fields, or when it loops through list of API results, it quickly becomes easier to just build the &amp;ldquo;real thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that you have an idea of how these builders are used, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look under the covers. At the heart of it all lies the base class, &lt;code>StripeObjectBuilder&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> random

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> self
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> __getattr__(self, field_name):
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">set_data_field&lt;/span>(value):
self&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>_data[field_name] &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> value

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> set_data_field
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The object structure will be held in the &lt;code>_data&lt;/code> field. &lt;code>_build_data()&lt;/code> finalizes building of the object structure (reason for this will become apparent when we look at the list object below) which is then passed to &lt;code>stripe.util.convert_to_stripe_object()&lt;/code> by &lt;code>build()&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Builder classes for specific Stripe objects will extend &lt;code>StripeObjectBuilder&lt;/code> and define the object structure by setting the &lt;code>_data&lt;/code> field in their constructor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>__getattr__&lt;/code> allows overwriting any field in the &lt;code>_data&lt;/code> dict and because &lt;code>self&lt;/code> is returned, these methods can be chained for concise object construction syntax, as illustrated with &lt;code>.amount_due(expected_amount)&lt;/code> in the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many Stripe objects like Customer, Subscription, etcetera have a metadata map for arbitrary key/value storage. We can build convenient support for that with the following extension:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">StripeObjectWithMetadataBuilder&lt;/span>(StripeObjectBuilder):

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> self
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Before we get to the Customer builder, we need to get one more bit of infrastructure out of the way; Lists. Enter the &lt;code>StripeListBuilder&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">StripeListBuilder&lt;/span>(StripeObjectBuilder):

&lt;p>The fixture &lt;code>_data&lt;/code> structure is based on the JSON hierarchy in the &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object">Customer API documentation&lt;/a>. Any extra fields can be added as needed, depending on your implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the Customer example above, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write builders for other Stripe objects. I built them as my integration required new objects and found myself re-using them over and over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To round things out, here is another example of a complicated set of connected Stripe objects, defined in a few lines using Stripe Object Builders:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">customer &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> (

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>email(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;jdoe@company.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>add_subscription_builder(
StripeSubscriptionBuilder()
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>add_item_builder(StripeItemBuilder(
StripePlanBuilder()
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>nickname(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;3dollarMontly&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>amount(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">300&lt;/span>)))
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>add_item_builder(StripeItemBuilder(
StripePlanBuilder()
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>nickname(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;6dollarMonthly&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>amount(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">600&lt;/span>)))
)
)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>build()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In 17 lines of code, we build a Customer called John Doe, who can be emailed at &lt;a href="mailto:jdoe@company.com">jdoe@company.com&lt;/a> about his lack of payment for a Subscription to the 3 and 6 dollars a month plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using object builders like these, I&amp;rsquo;ve written lots of self-contained, readable unit tests for my Stripe integration code. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the world needs it, but I have been toying with the idea of creating an open source library that takes the ideas outlined above, combined with Stripe&amp;rsquo;s OpenAPI fixture data, to provide an auto-generated full featured set of object builders for use in any Stripe integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, I hope this was useful to you. If it is, or if you have suggestions, be sure to drop me a line.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is easy to set up. In just a few clicks, gcloud commands or lines of Terraform configuration, you can access the Zeppelin UI and start creating Notebooks. A Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket is used to store the notebooks, which means that after re-creating the cluster for software or hardware changes, you can pick up where you left off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or so you’d hoped. I recently attempted to upgrade a Dataproc cluster with Zeppelin, from &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/dataproc-versions">image&lt;/a> version 1.4-debian10 to 1.5 and found that all my Notebooks were missing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially I thought something might be wrong with the distribution. After all, the release notes mentioned recent changes with Zeppelin and the GCSNotebookRepo plugin. But after digging a bit deeper, admittedly while writing up a Dataproc bug report on the issue, I found the cause of the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Zeppelin Notebooks version in the 1.5-debian10 image is a 0.9 variant, while the previous version was 0.8.2 and the Zeppelin Notebook storage format has &lt;a href="http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.9.0-preview2/setup/operation/upgrading.html#upgrading-from-zeppelin-08-to-09">changed with Zeppelin 0.9&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fix this, the Zeppelin upgrade guide mentions running an update script. I anticipated having to jump through a bunch of hoops to do this, since the Notebooks are stored in a GCS bucket.. but to my surprise, it turned out to be easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After upgrading the cluster to a 1.5-debian10 or even to the preview-debian10 image, run the following commands from a terminal with appropriately configured GCloud tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># Backup your notebook directory
gsutil cp -r &amp;quot;gs://$DATAPROC\_CLUSTER\_STAGING\_BUCKET/notebooks&amp;quot; \\
&amp;quot;gs://$DATAPROC\_CLUSTER\_STAGING\_BUCKET/notebooks-backup-$(date +&amp;quot;%Y-%m-%d&amp;quot;)&amp;quot;
# Execute the upgrade command
gcloud compute ssh --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE \\
\--command=&amp;quot;/usr/lib/zeppelin/bin/upgrade-note.sh -d&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>After running that, your notebooks should show up and work as before. (if the don&amp;rsquo;t, hit the Notebooks ♽ icon to trigger a reload)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully this will save you some time. If you have suggestions or would like to say hi, drop me a line.&lt;/p>

That sounds straightforward, after all most of this code doesn&amp;rsquo;t even really &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; anything. But as with most things in life, mistakes are made and thus small bugs find their way into your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing is the obvious answer to this problem. Now before you climb your high horse and start pouring out the bucket of arguments on how good coders don&amp;rsquo;t need to write tests–and definitely not for simple code–, how testing takes too much time, that your boss won&amp;rsquo;t let you- or whatever other bad excuse (copied-from-some-Quora-answer-you-may-or-may-not-have-found-on-Google) you can bring up; here is why I think unit testing is valuable:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Writing tests forces spending some extra time and focus on your code. Just doing that sometimes helps me find bugs, often in the most trivial code. Without testing, this would lead to embarrassing, costly production errors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Code under test is code that executes in your control. This helps build confidence, especially with a non-compiled language like Python.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A well tested codebase is like a coal mine with a thousand canaries. You&amp;rsquo;ll immediately see the impact of breaking changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If your code will be maintained by others in the future, they will value your tests for the same reasons, but in reverse order.&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>

self&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>assertEqual(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>, two_plus_two())
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Testing &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; code is easy. 2 + 2 should always be 4. Your thermostat should turn on the heat when the temperature drops below X, etcetera. All unit test frameworks have great support for this &amp;ldquo;transactional&amp;rdquo; kind of testing, but when all you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do is verify if something calls something else correctly, test code can become quite unwieldy.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">from&lt;/span> unittest &lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> TestCase

self&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>assertEqual(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>, two_plus_two())
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># ensure &amp;#39;add&amp;#39; was called correctly&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest&lt;/a> framework offers the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">mock&lt;/a> library, which lets you define fake methods that can verify wether they were called as intended. In the example above, &lt;code>patch.object&lt;/code> temporarily overwrites the &lt;code>add&lt;/code> method on &lt;code>imaginary_math_library&lt;/code> with a mock that always returns 4. When &lt;code>two_plus_two()&lt;/code> is called in the test, it will invoke the mock &lt;code>add&lt;/code> method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mock library works great, there are even some nice touches like the &lt;code>patch&lt;/code> context manager–used above–that are a great improvement over building your own mock objects and patching them into code under test. However, when you get serious with it, things become &lt;strong>verbose&lt;/strong> in a hurry. The reason for this verbosity is that it separates mock definition from call verification. Furthermore, mocks have to be &amp;ldquo;manually&amp;rdquo; injected or patched into code under test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have fond memories from back in the day when I wrote Java (a language normally regarded as one that re-defines the word verbose) of using a framework that offered a quick and simple way of applying mocks in unit testing, &lt;a href="https://site.mockito.org">Mockito&lt;/a>. Mockito uses a builder-pattern-like chained-method syntax that combines mock definition and installation. Verification is still done through separate calls, but despite that, tests written with Mockito are concise and readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One can only imagine my surprise and delight when, while looking around for ways to test Python code earlier this year, I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://github.com/kaste/mockito-python">mockito-python&lt;/a>, a Python implementation of the aforementioned Java library.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mockito-python (Mockito hereafter) takes a host of great features from it&amp;rsquo;s Java namesake and throws in a few extra to make things even better. Not only does it combine mock installation and definition in the same statements, expectations get set up simultaneously. This means that calls with unexpected parameters automatically cause test failures. Using Mockito, our little example is implemented this way:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">from&lt;/span> unittest &lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> TestCase

verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;code>verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed&lt;/code> will ensure that all mocks defined in a test are used. This is a feature that is absent from the Java library. It only needs to be called once, in contrast to explicit call verification which has to happen for every expected call in a test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the nature of your test suite, &lt;code>verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed&lt;/code> can be invoked from a &lt;code>tearDown()&lt;/code> method. This is also where you should invoke &lt;code>mockito.unstub()&lt;/code> which undoes all changes applied by Mockito, to prevent the next test from being surprised by side-effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mockito offers a whole host of argument &lt;a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the-matchers.html">Matchers&lt;/a> that can be used to describe parameter expectations and you can use an argument Captor to inspect parameters even further. Mocked methods can return fixed values, raise errors and even execute lambdas if dynamic results are needed in your test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole thing is &lt;a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">very well documented&lt;/a> and a joy to use. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a slew of test code with Mockito over the course of this year. Doing so has helped me find a bunch of silly bugs and most of all has helped me build confidence in my code-even the trivial parts!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since discovering &lt;a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Mockito&lt;/a> for Python, my proverbial coal mine is packed to the brim with canaries and I love it! I hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful to you too. If that is the case, or if you have suggestions, drop me line. &lt;a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Enjoy&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

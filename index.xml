Our son was born around the same time and so the site sat idle for a few months, but when I picked up writing back in November, the experience with Wordpress irked me. Wordpress is a fine CMS, it is great for getting a quick blog up and going, but I wanted more control over my content.</p><p>Recently,<a href="https://twitter.com/niels/status/1339617478406631425?s=20">much to my surprise</a>, I was able to re-register nielsvaneck.com and that inspired me to move my site and finally ditch Wordpress.</p><p>Being a software engineer, writing in Markdown and using a Git repository as a home for my content is more natural than using an opaque CMS. With that as a basis, there are some surprisingly simple methods for setting up a website / blog.<a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> offers basic (and free!) hosting from a Git repo. It can be configured to serve on custom hostnames and it even handles SSL! ‚úîÔ∏è</p><p>To get content in Markdown served up as HTML, GitHub Pages uses<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an HTML generator written in Ruby, but with a little bit of work,<a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, the &lsquo;static-site-generator-du-jour&rsquo;, can also be used.</p><p>So, in the span of an evening of tinkering, I now have the following setup:</p><ul><li>I used<a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown"><code>wordpress-export-to-markdown</code></a> to generate a Markdown version of my exported Wordpress site</li><li>that Markdown content is kept in a private Git repository</li><li>a GitHub action using<a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-remote"><code>hugo-remote</code></a> automatically generates static HTML pages when the Markdown content is updated and pushes changes to<a href="https://github.com/nielsvaneck/nielsvaneck.github.io/">nielsvaneck.github.io</a>, which is served at<a href="https://nielsvaneck.com">https://nielsvaneck.com</a> using GitHub Pages</li><li>a separate repository hosts a few simple HTML redirects to handle old links to posts on<a href="https://nve.ventures">https://nve.ventures</a> (also served on GitHub Pages)</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m not super happy with the looks of the site yet, but that&rsquo;s a matter of toying around with Hugo Themes. The important thing is that the setup works and that my content is fully in my control. üéâ</p><p>Hope that was useful, and as they say, watch this space.</p><p>-<a href="https://twitter.com/niels">@niels</a></p></content:encoded></item><item><title>‚ÄúMake‚Äù as a command interface to your repository</title><link>https://nielsvaneck.com/post/2020-11-21-make-as-a-command-interface-to-your-repository/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nielsvaneck.com/post/2020-11-21-make-as-a-command-interface-to-your-repository/</guid><description>Back in 1976, when Make first entered the scene, it solved the problem of automating dependency aware software builds.

Command vs Automatic Targets The ability to define build targets that could be invoked from the command line as make arguments, quickly lead to Make being used for other tasks than just building software, think of make install for example.</description><content:encoded><p>Back in 1976, when Make first entered the scene, it solved the problem of automating dependency aware software builds. By defining what sources a build target operates on, it could automatically determine what should be compiled based on what files had changed, thus saving on computing time while guaranteeing correct builds.</p><h2 id="command-vs-automatic-targets">Command vs Automatic Targets</h2><p>The ability to define build targets that could be invoked from the command line as<code>make</code> arguments, quickly lead to Make being used for other tasks than just building software, think of<code>make install</code> for example.</p><p>This &ldquo;extracurricular&rdquo; usage of the Make build tool proves useful to this day. A Makefile at the root of your repository provides a quick way to define commands for; bootstrapping the repository, running code-generation, executing tests, kicking off deployment and last but not least, if your project requires it, building executables. I have been thinking about these targets as &ldquo;commands&rdquo;, they are the main entry points into the functionality of your Makefile.</p><p>A well equipped makefile becomes a command line tool for your repository.</p><p>The beauty of Make is its dependency system. By defining prerequisites<em>(what targets should run before your target, and/or did any of the files-your- target-depends-on change, thus requiring your target to run)</em>, you can ensure for example; that code is built before running tests, or that tests re-execute with updated coverage tracking configuration, before opening the test-coverage report in a browser. Let&rsquo;s call targets in these dependency chains &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo; targets. They are like building blocks. You&rsquo;d rarely execute them individually, but together they enable powerful functionality.</p><p>In recent projects, I&rsquo;ve used Makefiles in this exact way. The Makefile offers a command line interface to the repository. It can be used to:</p><ul><li>bootstrap the repository</li><li>generate code</li><li>run various linters</li><li>run django, both as a server and in shell mode</li><li>run tests, with or without coverage tracking</li><li>open coverage reports in a browser (which of course automatically re-executes tests when necessary)</li><li>build docker containers</li><li>run django shell &amp; server inside the docker container</li><li>run tests inside of the docker container</li><li>deploy</li><li>configure cloud tools to target development, staging or production environments</li><li>forward ports to a kubernetes pod</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>All that, performed with required prerequisite work, by just running make with a simple argument. It has been a joy to use. But as so often in life, you can&rsquo;t have a silver lining without a cloud. This abundance of functionality in a Makefile brings with it two problems. 1) Silo-ing of potentially re-usable functionality and, 2), poor user experience, due to lack of target discoverability and an epic case of cognitive overload when trying to read through them.</p><h2 id="make-help">Make help</h2><p>Most Makefiles contain a boat load of targets, alphabetically-ish sorted if you&rsquo;re lucky. There is no good way to distinguish command targets from automatic targets, let alone to get a quick idea of what you can do with a Makefile.</p><p>Despite that shortcoming, I still thought it was worth writing about this particular way of Makefile usage. In past employment and projects, I‚Äôve seen countless examples of important commands having to be copied from documentation, and I don‚Äôt know how I would have done my job without relying heavily on bash history. Makefiles with a variety of command targets would have been very valuable to me in those days.</p><p>Then, while doing some research for this post, I came across<a href="https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-self-documenting-makefile/">how to create a self-documenting Makefile</a>, by<a href="https://victoria.dev/">Victoria Drake</a>.

Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p><ul><li>first it loops over<code>MAKEFILE_LIST</code> (a list of all lines in the makefile that define a target) using<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=egrep&amp;format=html"><code>egrep</code></a>, and retains the lines that have a<code>##</code> comment.</li><li>it then<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sort&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><code>sort</code></a>s the remaining items</li><li>and finally, runs the sorted lines through<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=awk&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><code>awk</code></a>`, with a few tricks<ul><li><code>BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "};</code><code>BEGIN</code> denotes a block that is to be executed before any input is processed. This block assigns<code>FS</code>, the<em>Field Separator</em>, to a regular expression that matches everything from the semicolon (which follows the target name), including the prerequisite list to the<code>##</code> that indicates a ‚Äòhelp‚Äô comment. This causes each Makefile target line to be broken up in the target name (<code>$1</code>) and the help comment (<code>$2</code>).</li><li><code>{printf "\033[36m%-20s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}</code>
this one seems a little tricky at first, as there is a lot going on, but simply put, it uses<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=printf&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><code>printf</code></a> to output the target name and the help comment in two columns.
Let‚Äôs break the format string into its parts:<ul><li><code>\033[</code> starts a terminal escape sequence and 36m then sets the text color to ‚Äúlight cyan‚Äù</li><li><code>%-20s</code> will print a string variable, the target name, padded on the right up to a width of 20 characters</li><li><code>\033[</code> starts another escape sequence in which<code>0m</code> resets the text color</li><li><code>%s\n</code> prints the second string variable, the help text, along with a newline character.</li><li><code>$$1</code>,<code>$$2</code> are the first and second parts of the line, target name and help comment as broken up based on the Field Separator rule defined earlier.<code>$$</code> because<code>$</code> needs to be doubled up inside a Makefile.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>With the<code>help</code> target defined in the Makefile, and &ldquo;command&rdquo; targets annotated with<code>## help text</code> comments, executing<code>make help</code> will now print out a quick overview of what you can do with the Makefile. Brilliant.</p><p>A nice side effect of<code>## help text</code> comments on command targets is that it visually separates them from their &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; siblings when reading through the Makefile.</p><h2 id="makefile-target-re-use">Makefile target re-use</h2><p>When using Makefiles as a command interface for your repository, it will likely contain targets that can be shared with other repositories in your organization or other projects you work on. The<code>help</code> target presented above is a prime example. Most Makefiles are self-contained. Their targets are specific to the repository and project they exist in. But Makefiles can<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html">include</a> other Makefiles, which offers a way to bring in common targets.</p><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">-include</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">common.mk</span></code></pre></div><p>Makefile includes can live in a different repository, a git submodule, a symlinked directory, etc. The possibilities are endless. The Makefile could even contain bootstrap logic to fetch the included files. If that is the case, ensure the include statements are prefixed with &ldquo;<code>-</code>&rdquo;. This will ignore import errors and allow targets in the Makefile to run without the include files being present, thus preventing a bootstrap / include catch-22 situation.</p><p>Over the past year, I have created Makefiles for various repositories based on the practices outlined above. Shared logic is brought in through git submodules and using make help, command targets are discoverable and documented. As an added bonus, maintaining and improving this toolkit is a great way to &ldquo;get in the zone&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll be using this wherever appropriate and I hope you will find it useful too.

Stripe&rsquo;s<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">documentation</a> is outstanding. Their API is intuitive and the language specific clients are easy to use. Each Stripe account comes with a test environment that makes development and integration testing effortless. The<a href="https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli"><code>stripe</code> command line tool</a> can be used for simple API queries, setting up authentication and testing of web hooks. On top of all that, there is<a href="https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock"><code>stripe-mock</code></a>, a local service with a near- complete implementation of the API that can be used for testing and development without requiring a network connection to the Stripe Test environment.</p><p>The issue with stripe-mock‚Äìand with testing against (near) &ldquo;real&rdquo; versions of any API‚Äìis that it adds additional overhead to each test because you‚Äôll likely have to use the API to define or tweak test data before it can be used. Once stripe-mock gets statefulness, that overhead will grow.</p><p>This is fine for end-to-end testing where having tests walk a pre-designed path of API interactions that follow real-world usage is a good thing to do, but for unit testing, this amount of overhead leads to heavy tests that are hard to read and difficult to write. Life teaches us that if something is hard, we&rsquo;re less likely to do lots of it. That is bad mojo for good test coverage.</p><p>In past projects, I have seen several ways of dealing with this problem, from a test-library of pre-defined hardcoded fixture data, to full-on crazy Java-style builder factory monstrosities with class names that put the average German word length to shame.</p><p>I started looking at the internals of the Stripe python API client and found something very interesting. The JSON structure returned by the API is parsed into a Python<code>dict</code> and then passed to a utility method that inspects the contents and builds the appropriate Stripe object hierarchy.</p><p>This sparked an idea. If I could define a Python<code>dict</code> with the right elements and invoke that Stripe utility method, I&rsquo;d be able to define and build Stripe objects on the fly. Sprinkle in a little bit of builder-pattern and I&rsquo;d have a quick, easy and readable way to build all varieties of Stripe objects needed to test my code. That in combination with Mockito (<a href="https://nielsvaneck.com/post/2020-11-10-testing-python-with-mockito/">a great mocking framework for Python</a>) would make for a very functional and pleasant way of unit testing a Stripe integration built with Python. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at a quick example of this through an imaginary Stripe integration function that retrieves the amount of an upcoming invoice for a customer defined by an email address.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll have to look up the customer in Stripe using the email address (bad practice, I know, but bear with me here) and then invoke the API endpoint that returns the upcoming invoice and grab its<code>amount_due</code> field. Note that<code>Customer.list</code> returns a collection of Customer objects, even if there&rsquo;s only one element.</p><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> stripe<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">upcoming_amount_due</span>(customer_email):

A Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket is used to store the notebooks, which means that after re-creating the cluster for software or hardware changes, you can pick up where you left off.</p><p>Or so you‚Äôd hoped. I recently attempted to upgrade a Dataproc cluster with Zeppelin, from<a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/dataproc-versions">image</a> version 1.4-debian10 to 1.5 and found that all my Notebooks were missing!</p><p>Initially I thought something might be wrong with the distribution. After all, the release notes mentioned recent changes with Zeppelin and the GCSNotebookRepo plugin. But after digging a bit deeper, admittedly while writing up a Dataproc bug report on the issue, I found the cause of the problem.</p><p>The Zeppelin Notebooks version in the 1.5-debian10 image is a 0.9 variant, while the previous version was 0.8.2 and the Zeppelin Notebook storage format has<a href="http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.9.0-preview2/setup/operation/upgrading.html#upgrading-from-zeppelin-08-to-09">changed with Zeppelin 0.9</a>.</p><p>To fix this, the Zeppelin upgrade guide mentions running an update script. I anticipated having to jump through a bunch of hoops to do this, since the Notebooks are stored in a GCS bucket.. but to my surprise, it turned out to be easy.</p><p>After upgrading the cluster to a 1.5-debian10 or even to the preview-debian10 image, run the following commands from a terminal with appropriately configured GCloud tools:</p><pre><code># Backup your notebook directory
gsutil cp -r "gs://$DATAPROC\_CLUSTER\_STAGING\_BUCKET/notebooks" \\
"gs://$DATAPROC\_CLUSTER\_STAGING\_BUCKET/notebooks-backup-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")"
# Execute the upgrade command
gcloud compute ssh --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE \\
\--command="/usr/lib/zeppelin/bin/upgrade-note.sh -d"</code></pre><p>After running that, your notebooks should show up and work as before. (if the don&rsquo;t, hit the Notebooks ‚ôΩ icon to trigger a reload)</p><p>Hopefully this will save you some time.

In the example above,<code>patch.object</code> temporarily overwrites the<code>add</code> method on<code>imaginary_math_library</code> with a mock that always returns 4. When<code>two_plus_two()</code> is called in the test, it will invoke the mock<code>add</code> method.</p><p>The mock library works great, there are even some nice touches like the<code>patch</code> context manager used above that are a great improvement over building your own mock objects and patching them into code under test. However, when you get serious with it, things become<strong>verbose</strong> in a hurry. The reason for this verbosity is that it separates mock definition from call verification. Furthermore, mocks have to be &ldquo;manually&rdquo; injected or patched into code under test.</p><p>I have fond memories from back in the day when I wrote Java (a language normally regarded as one that re-defines the word verbose) of using a framework that offered a quick and simple way of applying mocks in unit testing,<a href="https://site.mockito.org">Mockito</a>. Mockito uses a builder-pattern-like chained-method syntax that combines mock definition and installation. Verification is still done through separate calls, but despite that, tests written with Mockito are concise and readable.</p><p>One can only imagine my surprise and delight when, while looking around for ways to test Python code earlier this year, I stumbled upon<a href="https://github.com/kaste/mockito-python">mockito-python</a>, a Python implementation of the aforementioned Java library.</p><p>Mockito-python (Mockito hereafter) takes a host of great features from it&rsquo;s Java namesake and throws in a few extra to make things even better. Not only does it combine mock installation and definition in the same statements, expectations get set up simultaneously. This means that calls with unexpected parameters automatically cause test failures. Using Mockito, our little example is implemented this way:</p><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> unittest<span style="color:#f92672">import</span> TestCase<span style="color:#f92672">from</span> mockito<span style="color:#f92672">import</span> when, verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed<span style="color:#f92672">import</span> imaginary_math_library<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">two_plus_two</span>():<span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> imaginary_math_library<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>add(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>)<span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">SimpleMockitoTest</span>(TestCase):<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">test_two_plus_two</span>(self):

self<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>assertEqual(<span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>, two_plus_two())
verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed()</code></pre></div><p><code>verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed</code> will ensure that all mocks defined in a test are used. This is a feature that is absent from the Java library. It only needs to be called once, in contrast to explicit call verification which has to happen for every expected call in a test.</p><p>Depending on the nature of your test suite,<code>verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed</code> can be invoked from a<code>tearDown()</code> method. This is also where you should invoke<code>mockito.unstub()</code> which undoes all changes applied by Mockito, to prevent the next test from being surprised by side-effects.</p><p>Mockito offers a whole host of argument<a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the-matchers.html">Matchers</a> that can be used to describe parameter expectations and you can use an argument Captor to inspect parameters even further. Mocked methods can return fixed values, raise errors and even execute lambdas if dynamic results are needed in your test.</p><p>The whole thing is<a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">very well documented</a> and a joy to use. I&rsquo;ve written a slew of test code with Mockito over the course of this year. Doing so has helped me find a bunch of silly bugs and most of all has helped me build confidence in my code-even the trivial parts!</p><p>Since discovering<a href="https://mockito-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Mockito</a> for Python, my proverbial coal mine is packed to the brim with canaries and I love it! I hope it&rsquo;s useful to you too.
